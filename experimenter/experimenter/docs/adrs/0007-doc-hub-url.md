# "Docs Hub" URL

- Status: **accepted**
- Deciders: Kate Hudson, with input from Jared Lockhart, Lauren Zugai, Tim Smith, Les Orchard, Jody Heavener, Mark Reid

- Date: 2021-04-16

## Context and Problem Statement

We'd like to have a permanent URL for the experimenter docs hub that is:

- Memorable
- Stable
- Ideally, part of the rest of our data information architecture

## Considered Options

- Use the github.io URL
- Use a data.mozilla.org URL
- Use a custom domain (experimenter.info)

## Decision Outcome

We will use a custom domain for now (experimenter.info) until a decision is made on the general organization of data.mozilla.org in the future, at which time we will update the URL to fit in with the rest of our data documentation.
