<p>
  Hello,
</p>

<p>
  This is an automatic email from Experimenter about
  <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="{{ experiment.experiment_url }}">{{ experiment.name }}</a>,
  which went live on {{ experiment.start_date }}.
  Experimenter updates the proposed start date to the actual start date when
  the state changes to "Live". The subsequent scheduled change dates
  (ex: enrollment pause and experiment end) are recalculated based on
  the actual start date.
</p>

<p>
  Please watch your scheduled change dates as the data starts being gathered.
  If you need scheduling changes (ex: delay enrollment pause, delay end),
  please SLACK: #ask-experimenter. If everything looks good, no action is needed.
</p>

<p>
  Thank you!
</p>
<p>
Experimenter and Normandy Teams
