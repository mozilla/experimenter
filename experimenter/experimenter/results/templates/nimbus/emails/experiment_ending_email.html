<p>Hello,</p>

<p>
    This is an automatic email from the Nimbus Experimentation Platform to remind you to turn off an experiment you
    launched:
    <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="{{ experiment.experiment_url }}">{{ experiment.name }}</a>, which
    you previously configured to end on {{ experiment.proposed_end_date }}.
</p>

<p>
    Once you've confirmed with your engineering team, data scientist, and any important stakeholders that it's OK to end
    the experiment, you should do so <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
        href="{{ experiment.experiment_url }}">on this page</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Nimbus Engineering</p>
