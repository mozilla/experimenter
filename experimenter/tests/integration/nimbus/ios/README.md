# Nimbus iOS Integration test files

This folder contains test files used on our CI jobs to test the Nimbus integration with iOS. These files are used to replace the files within the `firefox-ios` repo when it is cloned during the job. This is done so that we can easily update the test configuration for testing against older releases.
