    Input Object Type Definition

    An input object defines a structured collection of fields which may be
    supplied to a field argument.

    Using ``graphene.NonNull`` will ensure that a input value must be provided by the query.

    All class attributes of ``graphene.InputObjectType`` are implicitly mounted as InputField
    using the below Meta class options.

    .. code:: python

        from graphene import InputObjectType, String, InputField

        class Person(InputObjectType):
            # implicitly mounted as Input Field
            first_name = String(required=True)
            # explicitly mounted as Input Field
            last_name = InputField(String, description="Surname")

    The fields on an input object type can themselves refer to input object types, but you can't
    mix input and output types in your schema.

    Meta class options (optional):
        name (str): the name of the GraphQL type (must be unique in schema). Defaults to class
            name.
        description (str): the description of the GraphQL type in the schema. Defaults to class
            docstring.
        container (class): A class reference for a value object that allows for
            attribute initialization and access. Default InputObjectTypeContainer.
        fields (Dict[str, graphene.InputField]): Dictionary of field name to InputField. Not
            recommended to use (prefer class attributes).
