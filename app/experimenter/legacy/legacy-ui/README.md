# Experimenter Legacy UI

In September 2020 this codebase began efforts to introduce a new version of Experimenter. Part of this change involved a new UI called Nimbus. In order to pave the way and create an optimal file hierarchy for the new front-end we have decided to move all the existing Experimenter front-end code into this directory, `legacy-ui`. It will remain maintained and functional until we are fully transitioned to Nimbus UI, at which point we will likely remove these files.

You can learn more about this decision in the following ADR: [Nimbus Front-End: Directory Tree Changes and Use React/CRA, Bootstrap, and GQL](https://github.com/mozilla/experimenter/blob/main/app/experimenter/docs/adrs/0002-nimbus-front-end-directory-tree-and-stack.md)
