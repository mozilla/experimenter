"""Parse ISO8601 dates.

Originally taken from :pypi:`pyiso8601`
(https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601)

Modified to match the behavior of ``dateutil.parser``:

    - raise :exc:`ValueError` instead of ``ParseError``
    - return naive :class:`~datetime.datetime` by default
    - uses :class:`pytz.FixedOffset`
